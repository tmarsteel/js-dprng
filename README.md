# jsdprng

Generate deterministic pesudo-random numbers, increase the seucrity of `Math.random()`. This implementation is particularly helpful when deterministic random sequences are required to be consistent across multiple platforms and languages. It relys only on simple bit operations that can easily be implemented consistently across many scripting languages (e.g. JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby)

A PHP implementation that generates equal sequences for the same salts/seeds can be found [here](//github.com/tmarsteel/php-dprng)

Please contribute with your own implementation in your favourite language! A description of the algorithm and test vectors can be found in [algorithm.md](algorithm.md). I`ll cross-link compliant forks :)

## Usage
Include the file or require() it.

```js
// secure random numbers (seeded from Math.random())
var rng = new tmarsteel.DPRNG();

// deterministic random sequence
var seed = 0xA2F38C0;
var rng = new tmarsteel.DPRNG(seed); 

// generate random numbers
var random = rng.next(); // random float from 0 inclusive to 1 exclusive (same range as Math.random())

var random = rng.nextInt(14, 300); // random integer in the range 14 to 299

var bytes = rng.nextBytes(30); // 30 random integers in the range 0 to 255
```

## Entropy / Randomness inspection
[ENT](http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/) is a neat program to inspect the entropy and randomness of a sequence of bytes or bits. This table compares its output with values returned from Math.random() in the most common browsers to that produced by this DPRNG. It shows that the numbers generated by `tmarsteel.DPRNG` are more secure/random. For explanations on the metrics see [the ENT Website](http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/)

## Methods
Here is a full list of the methods supported by `tmarsteel.DPRNG` objects and their signatures + contracts:

**`float next()`**  
Returns an uniformly distributed float value in the range `[0, 1)` (0 inclusive to 1 exclusive).

**`float nextFloat(float from, float to)`**  
Returns an uniformly distributed float value in the range `[from, to)` (`from` inclusive to `to` exclusive).

**`int nextInt(int from, int to)`**  
Returns an uniformly distributed integer in the range `[from, to]` (`from` inclusive to `to` inclusive).

**`array nextBytes(int n)`**  
Returns an array of length `n`. Each entry is a uniformly distributed integer between 0 and 255.
