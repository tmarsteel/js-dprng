# jsdprng

Generate deterministic pesudo-random numbers, significantly increase the seucrity of `Math.random()`.

## Usage
Include the file or require() it.

```js
// secure random numbers (seeded from Math.random())
var rng = new tmarsteel.DPRNG();

// deterministic random sequence
var seed = 0xA2F38C0;
var rng = new tmarsteel.DPRNG(seed); 

// generate random numbers
var random = rng.next(); // random float from 0 inclusive to 1 exclusive (same range as Math.random())

var random = rng.nextInt(14, 300); // random integer in the range 14 to 299

var bytes = rng.nextBytes(30); // 30 random integers in the range 0 to 255
```

## Entropy / Randomness inspection
[ENT](http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/) is a neat program to inspect the entropy and randomness of a sequence of bytes or bits. This table compares its output for values returned from Math.random() in the most common browsers to that produced by this DPRNG. It shows that the numbers generated by `tmarsteel.DPRNG` are significantly more secure:

| RNG | Browser | Entropy (0:bad, 8:perfect) | Arithmetic mean | Chi-Square | Correlation coefficient | Monte-Carlo PI |
| --- | ------- | -------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
Math.random() | Chrome | yet to be tested | yet to be tested | yet to be tested | yet to be tested | yet to be tested |
Math.random() | Firefox | yet to be tested | yet to be tested | yet to be tested | yet to be tested | yet to be tested |
Math.random() | Edge | yet to be tested | yet to be tested | yet to be tested | yet to be tested | yet to be tested |

## Methods
Here is a full list of the methods supported by `tmarsteel.DPRNG` objects and their signatures + contracts:

**`float next()`**
Returns an uniformly distributed float value in the range `[0, 1)` (0 inclusive to 1 exclusive).

**`float nextFloat(float from, float to)`**
Returns an uniformly distributed float value in the range `[from, to)` (`from` inclusive to `to` inclusive).

**`int nextInt(int from, int to)`**
Returns an uniformly distributed integer in the range `[from, to)` (`from` inclusive to `to` inclusive).

**`array nextBytes(int n)`**
Returns an array of length `n`. Each entry is a uniformly distributed integer between 0 and 255.
